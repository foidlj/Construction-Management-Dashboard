# Construction-Management-Dashboard

This was a group project I'd completed for BYU-I's Data Science Society. The client wanted an updated dashboard of a survey Construction Management students fill out for class. Our job was to simplify the dashboard by making fewer columns and mechanics that filter out certain columns or students based on conditional arguments. The survey was made with [Qualtrics.com](https://www.qualtrics.com/). The first step was making sure to make sure the order of questions was correct.

# API 

We used Qualtrics' [API](https://api.qualtrics.com/) to pull the survey from the web and wrangled data to the point where we had half the original survey (most of thrown out columns were questions like IP, Time Survey Started/Ended, Machine Location, etc.).
